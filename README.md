```text 
I am a full stack data science/analytics professional. 
I specialize in product & marketing analytics topics and have spent the majority of my career using data to support decision makers in those areas.

I studied Business Analytics at UCL and currently work at trivago HQ in Germany. 
Prior to this, I worked at a SouthEast Asia's Decacorn (GO-JEK) and an AI startup in London.

At work I make slides to deliver insights, crunch data, or code & develop models. 
But in my leisure time, I drown myself into wide array of hobbies. 
I play several musical instruments, mainly piano (I love Chopin and Bach!) and guitar, 
as well as read books (mostly classics literature or my list on Goodreads). 
During my undergraduate years, I also won table tennis silver medal in campus sport olympiad and several national level Case Competitions.
